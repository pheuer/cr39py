Contributing to cr39py
======================

.. _contributing:

User contributions to cr39py are welcome! You can contribute by:

* Submitting bug reports or requests for new features on the `GitHub repository issues page <https://github.com/pheuer/cr39py/issues>`_.
* Opening pull requests on the `GitHub repository pull request page <https://github.com/pheuer/cr39py/pulls>`_ to contribute new code yourself.
* Sharing cr39py with others who might find it useful.

If you wish to contribute code, please follow the guidelines below:

* First, open an issue describing the feature you want to add, so we can discuss whether it fits within the scope of the project and possible ways to implement it.
* Fork the repository and create a new branch for your feature. If your edits are accepted, this entire branch will be merged into cr39py, so only include necessary changes.
* Early on in the development process, open a pull request to the main branch of the original repository. This will allow us to provide feedback and help you steer your implementation in the right direction. If you are still working, mark your pull request as a 'draft'.
* Write tests and documentation for your feature. Test coverage and high quality documentation are required.
* When you think your pull request is ready, mark it for review. We will provide feedback and iterate with you to make any necessary changes.
* Once your pull request is approved, it will be merged into the main branch and included in the next release of cr39py!

Since this is a small project, we don't have a detailed contributor guide. For lots of helpful information on contributing to open source projects, check out the `PlasmaPy contributor guide <https://docs.plasmapy.org/en/latest/contributing/index.html>`_.
